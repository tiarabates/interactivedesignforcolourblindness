Interactive Design For Colour Blindness 
Overview
The project is an interactive artwork designed to accommodate individuals with colour blindness. The project allows users to toggle between multiple color palettes, each tailored to enhance visibility and contrast for different types of color blindness, including:

Deuteranopia (Green blindness)
Protanopia (Red blindness)
Tritanopia (Blue blindness)

By providing an interactive user interface (UI) that adjusts color filters in real-time, the project ensures that individuals with colour vision deficiencies can enjoy and fully engage with visual art.

Features
Interactive UI: Users can click buttons to apply colour blindness filters to the artwork, allowing them to toggle between different color palettes.
Multiple Filters: The project includes three types of color blindness filters:
Deuteranopia: Simulates green blindness by removing the green channel from the image.
Protanopia: Simulates red blindness by removing the red channel.
Tritanopia: Simulates blue blindness by removing the blue channel.
Image Switching: Users can also change the image being displayed, offering dynamic interactivity.
Reset Option: Allows users to return to the original, unmodified image with a click of a button.

Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need the following software:

Python (Recommended version: Python 3.x)
Processing (for running the artwork and handling graphical output)
ControlP5 Library (for creating UI elements like buttons)
Steps to Install
Install Python:

Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Install Processing IDE:

Download and install Processing from https://processing.org/download/.
Install ControlP5 Library:

In the Processing IDE, go to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library.
Search for ControlP5 and click Install.

Clone the Repository:

Download the project files from the repository (or copy the code into a new Processing sketch).

Run the Sketch:

Open the sketch in Processing and run it. The artwork should appear with the interactive buttons to control the color blindness filters.
Usage

Interactivity:

When you run the program, an image will be displayed on the canvas.
You will see buttons at the bottom of the window to toggle between different color blindness filters (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia).
You can also use the "Reset Image" button to return to the original image and "Change Image" to cycle through a predefined set of images.
Adjusting for Color Vision Deficiency:

Click on the buttons to simulate the experience of Deuteranopia, Protanopia, or Tritanopia and see how these types of colour blindness affect the image.
The filters modify the colors in real-time, allowing you to view the artwork through different color blindness lenses.
